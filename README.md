UI That runs a designated external program periodically, and by demand.
It shows current status of the run.

Needs some improvement - 
Append stdout more maleably. Clarify time of next run.
Overhaul the user interface (using the Hadas outline is an option).
Clarify status of last run and run history somehow.
